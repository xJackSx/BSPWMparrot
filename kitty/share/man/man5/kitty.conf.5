kitty.conf \- kitty.conf Documentation
.sp
\fIkitty\fP is highly customizable, everything from keyboard shortcuts, to rendering
frames\-per\-second. See below for an overview of all customization possibilities.
.sp
You can open the config file within kitty by pressing \fI\%ctrl+shift+f2\fP
(\fB⌘+,\fP on macOS). A \fBkitty.conf\fP with commented default
configurations and descriptions will be created if the file does not exist.
You can reload the config file within kitty by pressing \fI\%ctrl+shift+f5\fP
(\fB⌃+⌘+,\fP on macOS) or sending kitty the \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal.
You can also display the current configuration by pressing \fI\%ctrl+shift+f6\fP
(\fB⌥+⌘+,\fP on macOS).
.sp
\fIkitty\fP looks for a config file in the OS config directories (usually
\fB~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf\fP) but you can pass a specific path via the
\fI\%kitty \-\-config\fP option or use the \fI\%KITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY\fP
environment variable. See \fI\%kitty \-\-config\fP for full details.
.sp
Comments can be added to the config file as lines starting with the \fB#\fP
character. This works only if the \fB#\fP character is the first character in the
line.
.sp
You can include secondary config files via the \fBinclude\fP directive.  If
you use a relative path for \fBinclude\fP, it is resolved with respect to the
location of the current config file. Note that environment variables are
expanded, so \fB${USER}.conf\fP becomes \fBname.conf\fP if
\fBUSER=name\fP\&. Also, you can use \fBglobinclude\fP to include files
matching a shell glob pattern and \fBenvinclude\fP to include configuration
from environment variables. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include other.conf
# Include *.conf files from all subdirs of kitty.d inside the kitty config dir
globinclude kitty.d/**/*.conf

and even specify special fonts for particular characters.

You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold\-italic variants.
To get a full list of supported fonts use the \fBkitty +list\-fonts\fP command.
By default they are derived automatically, by the OSes font system. When
\fI\%bold_font\fP or \fI\%bold_italic_font\fP is set to \fBauto\fP on macOS, the
priority of bold fonts is semi\-bold, bold, heavy. Setting them manually is
useful for font families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium,
Thick, etc.
For example:

kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL scripts,
words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say, in an RTL script, the
words \(dqHELLO WORLD\(dq display in kitty as \(dqWORLD HELLO\(dq, and if you try to select
a substring of an RTL\-shaped string, you will get the character that would be
there had the the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word
ירושלים, selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם actually
writes into the selection buffer the character י.  kitty\(aqs default behavior is
useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse the word order, however, if you
wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it can be very challenging to work with, so this
option is provided to turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the
command line program \fI\%GNU FriBidi\fP to get BIDI support, because it
will force kitty to always treat the text as LTR, which FriBidi expects for
terminals.

Map the specified Unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need
special rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
patched fonts. Each Unicode code point is specified in the form \fBU+<code
point in hexadecimal>\fP\&. You can specify multiple code points, separated by
commas and ranges separated by hyphens. This option can be specified multiple
times. The syntax is:

Usually, for Private Use Unicode characters and some symbol/dingbat characters,
if the character is followed by one or more spaces, kitty will use those extra
cells to render the character larger, if the character in the font has a wide
aspect ratio. Using this option you can force kitty to restrict the specified
code points to render in the specified number of cells (defaulting to one cell).
This option can be specified multiple times. The syntax is:

Choose how you want to handle multi\-character ligatures. The default is to
always render them. You can tell kitty to not render them when the cursor is
over them by using \fBcursor\fP to make editing easier, or have kitty never
render them at all by using \fBalways\fP, if you don\(aqt like them. The ligature
strategy can be set per\-window either using the kitty remote control facility
or by defining shortcuts for it in \fBkitty.conf\fP, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never

Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This is useful as
some fonts might have features worthwhile in a terminal. For example, Fira Code
includes a discretionary feature, \fBzero\fP, which in that font changes the
appearance of the zero (0), to make it more easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira
Code also includes other discretionary features known as Stylistic Sets which
have the tags \fBss01\fP through \fBss20\fP\&.
.sp
For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
\fI\%HarfBuzz documentation\fP\&.
.sp
Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font family. This
allows you to define very precise feature settings; e.g. you can disable a
feature in the italic font but not in the regular font.
.sp
On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database and then
this option is applied, so they can be configured in a single, central place.
.sp
To get the PostScript name for a font, use \fBkitty +list\-fonts \-\-psnames\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ kitty +list\-fonts \-\-psnames | grep Fira

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of the underline and strikethrough.
The modifications can have the suffix \fBpx\fP for pixels or \fB%\fP for percentage of original value.
No suffix means use pts. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
modify_font underline_position \-2
modify_font underline_thickness 150%
modify_font strikethrough_position 2px
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each font glyph is rendered and the baseline
at which the glyph is placed in the cell. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
modify_font cell_width 80%
modify_font cell_height \-2px
modify_font baseline 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the underline and strikethrough positions
by the same amount. Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and decreasing it lowers them.
Decreasing the cell size might cause rendering artifacts, so use with care.

shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This sets the
default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal can override it. In
particular, \fI\%shell integration\fP in kitty sets the

Note that using very large scrollback is not recommended as it can slow down
performance of the terminal and also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider

approximatively 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,

\fBb1\fP ... \fBb8\fP with added keyboard modifiers. For example:
\fBctrl+shift+left\fP refers to holding the \fBCtrl+Shift\fP keys while
clicking with the left mouse button. The value \fBb1\fP ... \fBb8\fP can be
used to refer to up to eight buttons on a mouse.
.sp
\fBevent\-type\fP is one of \fBpress\fP, \fBrelease\fP,
\fBdoublepress\fP, \fBtriplepress\fP, \fBclick\fP, \fBdoubleclick\fP\&.
\fBmodes\fP indicates whether the action is performed when the mouse is
grabbed by the program running in the terminal, or not. The values are
\fBgrabbed\fP or \fBungrabbed\fP or a comma separated combination of them.
\fBgrabbed\fP refers to when the program running in the terminal has requested
mouse events. Note that the click and double click events have a delay of
\fI\%click_interval\fP to disambiguate from double and triple presses.

You can run kitty with the \fI\%kitty \-\-debug\-input\fP command line option
to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense of what is

The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where one is
opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if supported by the OS
(for instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note that it only sets the
background color\(aqs opacity in cells that have the same background color as the
default terminal background, so that things like the status bar in vim,
powerline prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be rendered as
transparent. Instead you should change the default background color in your
kitty config and not use a background color in the editor color scheme. Or use
the escape codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch
your editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change transparency of
windows, set \fI\%dynamic_background_opacity\fP to \fByes\fP (this is off by
default as it has a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the

\fBbackground\fP) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It
sets the background color of the entire window and makes the titlebar

left, right or both \fBOption\fP keys as \fBAlt\fP, instead. Note that kitty
itself always treats \fBOption\fP the same as \fBAlt\fP\&. This means you cannot

Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in multiple mappings.
Aliases can be defined for any action and will be expanded recursively. For
example, the above alias allows you to create mappings to launch a new tab in
the current working directory without duplication:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
map f1 launch_tab vim
map f2 launch_tab emacs

Like \fI\%action_alias\fP above, but specifically for kittens. Generally, prefer
to use \fI\%action_alias\fP\&. This option is a legacy version, present for
backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of the aliased kitten to be
substituted. So the example above will cause all invocations of the hints kitten
to have the \fI\%\-\-hints\-offset=0\fP
option applied.

.sp
It is also possible to remap \fBCtrl+L\fP to both scroll the current screen

Reload \fBkitty.conf\fP, applying any changes since the last time it was
loaded. Note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically changed and
require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when changing shortcuts for
actions located on the macOS global menu bar, a full restart is needed. You can
also map a keybinding to load a different config file, for example:

.B Send arbitrary text on key presses
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF\-8) encoded text to the client program
when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will send \(dqSpecial text\(dq when you press the \fBCtrl+Alt+A\fP key
combination. The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use
escapes like \fBx1b\fP to send control codes or \fBu21fb\fP to send
Unicode characters (or you can just input the Unicode characters directly as
UTF\-8 text). You can use \fBkitty +kitten show_key\fP to get the key escape
codes you want to emulate.
.sp
The first argument to \fBsend_text\fP is the keyboard modes in which to
activate the shortcut. The possible values are \fBnormal\fP,
\fBapplication\fP, \fBkitty\fP or a comma separated combination of them.
The modes \fBnormal\fP and \fBapplication\fP refer to the DECCKM
cursor key mode for terminals, and \fBkitty\fP refers to the kitty extended
keyboard protocol. The special value \fBall\fP means all of them.
.sp
Some more examples:
.INDENT 0.0
